# Calculator

We will make a basic calculator using python.
This calculator app will have basic functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and percentage.
For the GUI we use PyQt5 and for calculations we use the eval() function with sanitised inputs.
Here we do a lot of processing to the input so that the expression is in the correct format, and thereby the eval() function can work as expected.

To run the app:

```
python Calculator.py
```
